# Feature Implementation Audit

This document summarizes the current state of the implemented code against the expected Auto Repair Shop Management System backend feature set. Each section highlights critical gaps or defects that would prevent the advertised functionality from working in production.

## Authentication & Security

* **Login flow is internally inconsistent.** The main login handler has duplicated logic, references undefined variables (`data`, `security`), and never verifies the user's 2FA token even when a secret is set, so login will crash before returning a token.【F:backend/app/auth/routes.py†L59-L115】
* **Password reset helpers are missing.** Both reset endpoints rely on `security.create_reset_token` and `security.verify_reset_token`, but neither helper exists in `app/core/security.py`, which only defines password hashing and access tokens.【F:backend/app/auth/routes.py†L126-L146】【F:backend/app/core/security.py†L1-L28】
* **Duplicate, conflicting route declarations.** The file redeclares request models and password-reset endpoints with different logic, making imports ambiguous and causing FastAPI to register endpoints under incorrect paths (e.g., `/auth/auth/login`).【F:backend/app/auth/routes.py†L1-L200】
* **Audit middleware is incomplete.** The middleware only logs basic action text, never records latency, IP, or user agent, and instantiates a new Prisma client per request without exception handling, so it does not satisfy the auditing requirements and risks connection leaks.【F:backend/app/core/audit.py†L1-L31】

## Appointments & Scheduling

* **Module import errors and duplication.** The file starts with indented imports (syntactically invalid), redefines `AppointmentCreate`, and re-registers routers under `/appointments/appointments`, which would break FastAPI startup.【F:backend/app/appointments/routes.py†L1-L120】
* **Auto-scheduling absent.** There is no logic to locate the first available technician/bay slot; the create endpoint simply persists the provided data without availability checks.【F:backend/app/appointments/routes.py†L21-L120】
* **Reminders and recurring maintenance missing.** Aside from an email stub that calls `send_email` with the wrong parameter names, there is no SMS support, recurring contract handling, or maintenance reminder scheduling.【F:backend/app/appointments/routes.py†L52-L88】
* **Calendar integration stubs are incomplete.** The calendar module mixes banking routes, lacks token helpers (`get_user_google_token`, etc.), and never returns ICS data, so external sync and public feeds cannot work.【F:backend/app/calendar/routes.py†L1-L120】

## Work Bays

* **Routes double-prefix endpoints.** Paths such as `@router.put("/bays/{id}/status")` and `@router.get("/bays")` result in `/bays/bays/...`, and there is no locking logic to prevent double-booking or integrate with appointments when a job finishes.【F:backend/app/bays/routes.py†L1-L34】
* **Unused/undefined utilities.** The module imports PDF utilities, email senders, and Prisma clients multiple times but never uses them, indicating unfinished integrations.【F:backend/app/bays/routes.py†L1-L20】

## Alerts & Notifications

* **Undefined dependencies.** Alert handlers call helpers such as `notify_user`, `send_sms`, and `notify_slack` that are either missing arguments or completely undefined, so notifications will crash at runtime.【F:backend/app/alerts/routes.py†L1-L200】【F:backend/app/core/notifier.py†L1-L38】
* **Configuration not wired.** The code references `MAX_BAY_JOBS_PER_DAY` without importing the setting, so overutilization checks will raise `NameError` before completing.【F:backend/app/alerts/routes.py†L45-L80】
* **Inventory SLA logic incorrect.** Low-stock queries compare `quantityOnHand` to the literal string `"minThreshold"`, guaranteeing that no results ever match.【F:backend/app/alerts/routes.py†L170-L190】

## Banking & Accounting

* **CSV import lacks validation.** The importer trusts CSV headers and types without error handling, so malformed uploads will raise exceptions and leave the request open.【F:backend/app/bank/routes.py†L51-L68】
* **Vendor bill endpoints referenced elsewhere are missing.** Other modules expect vendor bill creation and reconciliation helpers, but only basic transaction endpoints are present.【F:backend/app/calendar/routes.py†L1-L40】【F:backend/app/bank/routes.py†L23-L49】
* **QuickBooks integration absent.** There is no placeholder service or configuration usage beyond environment variables, so advertised syncing cannot function.【F:backend/app/bank/routes.py†L1-L68】

## Communication

* **No persistence for chat.** WebSocket chat simply rebroadcasts in-memory messages; nothing is stored or authenticated, so history retrieval endpoints are missing and messages disappear on restart.【F:backend/app/communication/routes.py†L34-L50】
* **Internal notes lack validation.** Notes allow any technician to target any appointment/vehicle without ownership checks or authorization beyond a static role list.【F:backend/app/communication/routes.py†L20-L32】

## Admin Dashboard

* **Metrics incomplete and inconsistent.** Dashboard endpoints compute metrics but never expose user/vehicle/job breakdowns described in the requirements, and the warranty status update block is detached from its route definition due to indentation errors.【F:backend/app/admin/routes.py†L12-L200】
* **Missing audit log listing.** There is no endpoint for paginated audit logs or maintenance hooks like reindex triggers.【F:backend/app/admin/routes.py†L1-L200】

## Broadcast & Real-Time

* **No error handling or cleanup.** Broadcast helpers blindly iterate websocket sets without guarding against disconnects, so a broken connection will raise and stop the broadcast loop.【F:backend/app/core/broadcast.py†L1-L21】
* **Dependency on undefined globals.** The module imports `active_connections` and `tech_connections` from `ws.routes`, but there is no evidence of lifecycle management for those structures in this repository snapshot.【F:backend/app/core/broadcast.py†L1-L21】

## Core Configuration

* **Missing validation.** Settings load environment variables but never validate required secrets in production or expose SMTP/Google/QuickBooks configuration objects needed by other modules.【F:backend/app/core/config.py†L1-L26】

### Conclusion
The codebase contains extensive duplication, syntax errors, and missing dependencies across nearly every module. As written, the backend would fail to start under FastAPI, and even if corrected, most of the advertised functionality (2FA, scheduling intelligence, notifications, external integrations) remains unimplemented. Substantial refactoring and feature development are required before the system can meet the stated expectations.
